You should open all pocket pairs, most suited aces, broadway hands, suited connectors, and many suited one-gappers. The key principle is that position compensates for raw hand strength."

This polarized range includes strong value hands (99+, ATs+) and suited ace bluffs (A3s-A5s). The SB 3-bet range is wider than CO vs BTN because the CO opens tighter than the BTN, but you need to fight for the pot to avoid losing your blind."

Your value range is narrow (JJ+, AQs+, AKo) and you add a small number of bluffs (A5s/A4s) for balance. Most other hands should defend by calling, as 3-betting light against a strong range is -EV."
