You can win by: (1) villain folding right now, (2) hitting your flush on the river, or (3) bluffing the river if a heart comes. The combination of fold equity + draw equity makes this a clear bet.",

By checking, you let the preflop raiser c-bet (which they should do frequently on this board), and you can then check-call to keep their bluffs in and set up for a check-raise on the turn or a big river bet.",
